Alright here are some tips to get you started. Let me start by saying..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Podcasts are a weird topic. Some people love them, some people hate them. From what I have noticed , younger audiences aren’t exactly “Podcast Lovers”. Most tech users prefer to watch a video our scroll a feed instead of hearing someone talk about a particular topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Podcasts can be really interesting, particularly if you are into a very specific topic. There are general podcasts about things like “Tech”, “Politics”, “Comedy”, “Sports”, of course. But podcasts are interesting when they get really specific, and they do. Podcasts about “Stuff you should know”, “The financials of a startup”, “Makeup”, “Apple only podcasts”. Podcasts are fun when you get into a very specific topic and listen to enthusiasts (just like you )talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Podcasts are fun when you get into a very specific topic and listen to enthusiasts (just like you) talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, yeah, you can listen to them where ever an when ever. Driving, running, in the gym, biking, and working (please don’t.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in order to enjoy podcasts, you have to listen to them the right way. &lt;strong&gt;Here’s how:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1please-dont-use-apples-stock-podcast-app&quot;&gt;1.Please don’t use Apple’s stock Podcast app&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I recommend an app to listen to podcasts I always recommend the same one: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/&quot;&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt;.” Here is why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Podcast app from Apple is purple, and this one is &lt;strong&gt;orange, which is clearly cooler.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overcast makes better &lt;strong&gt;recommendations&lt;/strong&gt; based on who you follow on Twitter, or general interests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overcast has a much bigger database of podcasts and better search engine. &lt;strong&gt;Apple blocks some podcasts, Overcast doesn’t&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The player has features like “voice boost” and “smart speed” which can clearly improve your &lt;strong&gt;listening experience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have &lt;strong&gt;more settings&lt;/strong&gt; to control storage, synching, and other stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The app &lt;strong&gt;treats you like a Podcast beginner, and not just a user&lt;/strong&gt;, that matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So start by downloading it &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Time to add some podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+EuQkHpOns&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mashtalk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This podcast is hosted by Mashable’s tech team &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@film_girl&quot;&gt;Christina Warren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@LanceUlanoff&quot;&gt;Lance Ulanoff&lt;/a&gt; and Pete Pachal. They take a very good approach to the week’s &lt;strong&gt;top technology topics&lt;/strong&gt;. I recommend this podcast to anyone that want to get a &lt;strong&gt;fast and clear tech digest of the week&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+F18VhmgLU&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too embarassed to ask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too embarrassed to ask is a podcast about technology in general that tries to &lt;strong&gt;interact with listeners&lt;/strong&gt; as much as possible. Which is great to listen to replies to questions you could actually ask. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@laurengoode&quot;&gt;Lauren Goode&lt;/a&gt;’s good mood and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karaswisher&quot;&gt;Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt;’s cynicism match in a &lt;strong&gt;glorious and funny way&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+DjLOsfy6g&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clockwise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably one of my favourite podcasts of all time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jsnell&quot;&gt;Jason Snell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dmoren&quot;&gt;Dan Moren&lt;/a&gt;invite two guests each week and talk about &lt;strong&gt;4 technology topics in 30 minutes or less&lt;/strong&gt;. A very interesting insight into the world of technology by two hosts that &lt;strong&gt;clearly know their way around the topic&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-top-3-non-tech-podcasts-i-recommend&quot;&gt;3. Top 3 non-tech podcasts I recommend.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+BYAbbPgf4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kristatippett&quot;&gt;Krista Tippett&lt;/a&gt; tries to answer the &lt;strong&gt;most asked questions of meaning by talking to the most interesting guests ever&lt;/strong&gt;. From noble prize winners, physicists, and artists. Her interviewing skills never cease to amaze the hell out of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+BYAbbPgf4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planet Money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This podcast is similar to the book Freakonomics. It is about &lt;strong&gt;explaining the complex (and sometimes abstract) world of Economics, but doing it in a simple and accessible way&lt;/strong&gt;. A very interesting one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+VzjmI8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stuff you should know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josh and Chuck pick a topic each week, do in-depth research about it and then talk about their findings in a podcast. &lt;strong&gt;“How LSD works”, “How the Big Bang Works” or “How the Gender Pay Gap Works” are just a few examples of themes they cover&lt;/strong&gt;. A fun, but at the same time interesting podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pura &lt;strong&gt;estupidez&lt;/strong&gt; num podcast semanal. O que é que queremos mais? Filipe Melo, Bruno Nogueira e Nuno Markl juntam-se para discutir dilemas fictícios num podcast cheio de humor. &lt;strong&gt;Outra vez, estupido? Sim. Divertido? Também.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+BqDwFTzQ&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governo Sombra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toda a gente conhece este programa semanal da TSF. Ricardo Araújo Pereira, Pedro Mexia e João Miguel Tavares comentam os temas mais falados da semana num &lt;strong&gt;programa repleto de ironia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/+Bq8nkfQk&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloco Central&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Um dos meus podcasts portugueses preferidos. Pedro Adão e Silva e Pedro Marques Lopes fazem a analise politica da semana. Visões interessantes de duas pessoas que claramente percebem do assunto. &lt;strong&gt;Melhor que ler jornais durante a semana. O essencial da politica num programa semanal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>duarteocarmo</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="technology" /><category term="podcasts" /><summary type="html">So you want to start listenning to podcasts?

&lt;p&gt;But did you know that not all apps are for public download? Enterprise apps are generally not available for public use. What are enterprise apps? Simply, they are apps designed for businesses that make everyday work-related tasks easier for employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies use apps for business use downloaded from the App Store and Google Play Store, so what’s the difference between enterprise apps and consumer apps? More importantly, what type of application do you need to meet business goals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;consumer-apps&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer Apps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Generally made for a specific target market but can really be used by anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designed to improve the everyday life of users sometimes for free or for a fee. For example, Whatsapp makes communication easy and free between two or more people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The apps can be downloaded in public app stores like the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. Depending on the content, the apps can also be downloaded by anyone in any country. The more downloads the better for the developer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;User-centered design should be a priority for consumer apps which can be a challenge as that can mean designing for a massive audience across the globe. The key is that aesthetics and trends need to be considered when designing these types of apps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inherently fun and pleasing to use in terms of user experience and design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enterprise-apps&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise Apps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tailored-made for businesses. For example, SKY, the largest paid TV broadcaster in the UK, created an internal app so that sales teams could report their results to the rest of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Access is – should be – restricted to employees of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These apps have the sole focus on productivity and to create efficiencies in business processes. As a general rule, these apps are simple, pragmatic and very utilitarian.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even though the user experience is still important, the fact that an app should be pleasing to the eye is often seen as an unnecessary cost. Corporate apps are often considered to be simply a tool that is more about accomplishing a task and less about an experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bottom-line&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differences between enterprise apps and consumer apps are clear. Consumer apps can be created for a broad range of users and usage contexts in mind – though, a proper consumer app is specific to solving an issue for a target market. Enterprise apps have very specific use cases and a narrow context (when compared to consumer apps). They both value design and the user experience, but, as far as aesthetics and embellishments are concerned enterprise apps are designed to complete tasks quickly and used in a business setting. If an animation takes 200 milliseconds to finish and the user views that animation 1000 times per day that adds up to 2 hours per year. That may not seem like a lot but time is money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important thing to bear in mind is that design isn’t only about colors and aesthetics. Design, particularly with mobile apps, is about making the user’s life easier, not more pretty. This is true for enterprise apps as well. Nowadays, companies are able to move into global markets easier. Hiring remote workers may be a way to expand into other markets while keeping overheads down by not opening physical offices. Having an enterprise app will help keep employees unified and by incorporating good design, more employees would be encouraged to use the app to reach company goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Good design is as little design as possible.” Dieter Rams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, having good design can actually help in saving precious time and effort even when using enterprise apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately enough, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blissapplications.com/&quot;&gt;Bliss&lt;/a&gt; is a user-centered design company, which means that we give as much importance to design as we give to development.

But in the last couple of years, in the context of business and specifically product development, MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick look at Wikipedia and the meaning is clear: &lt;em&gt;a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers.&lt;/em&gt; The concept was made popular by Eric Ries in his 2011 best seller book: The Lean Startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering: “but what forms can an MVP take?” The answer is many. One might consider a simple landing page or product explainer video for your product/idea to be an MVP. Another common shape MVPs take are prototypes, for example, when starting a crowdfunding campaign, a simple prototype can increase your funding possibilities exponentially. An MVP can be said to be a form, part, or representation of your product that allows you to test it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy of developing an MVP has become standard these days amongst start-ups. It can be summed up by putting something that is only “good enough” in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending so many hours planning out your great app idea, you’re probably wondering: &lt;strong&gt;Why on earth would I develop something that is only “good enough”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why “good enough” is probably exactly what you need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-its-cheaper&quot;&gt;1. It’s Cheaper.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, you are probably in no position to be a big spender. Unless you have millions in funding, you may be worried about finances right about now. By making something good enough with limited features or by “cutting down the fat”, you won’t end up with something that looks like your grand idea or that you imagined. On the bright side, however, you reduce the cost spent and risk if the product doesn’t perform as well as you may have thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Reid Hoffman (founder of LinkedIn) said: “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-its-faster&quot;&gt;2. It’s Faster.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focusing only on the essentials, you will save time, which today, in a saturated technology market, can be very precious. Because&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.blissapplications.com/2017/04/10/how-to-stay-ahead-of-changing-technology/&quot;&gt; markets are constantly changing&lt;/a&gt;, time to market can be a critically short window for start-ups. You need to get out there and get out there sooner than later. For investors, proving that you can go to market quickly means that they will get their money back faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-it-gets-people-talking&quot;&gt;3. It Gets People Talking.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have an MVP, you have what can be called a “proof of concept”. Having something in your hands that you can show, even if it’s just a prototype, can get people talking about it. Remember, most people need to see it to believe it (or invest in it). Being able to go to market quicker and taking something tangible to an investor can mean one critical element for your product: get that funding (yeah, unfortunately, passion is not enough.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.blissapplications.com/2017/07/06/so-you-have-a-great-app-idea-now-what/&quot;&gt;An idea excites people of course&lt;/a&gt;, but a product (even a limited one) excites people even more and creates more hype for your product. Turn an empty proposition into a valuable one. Believers will become buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-its-good-strategy&quot;&gt;4. It’s Good Strategy.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing an MVP allows you to incrementally develop your product in a step-by-step approach. Furthermore, having something essential not only means that you have more flexibility to add features to it but also that you can remove features or revert to a previous version without any added costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case that was confusing (sorry) here is a sketch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*0LyDchAZUvJljzRp.&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bottom-line&quot;&gt;Bottom Line.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.blissapplications.com/2017/06/08/5-common-pitfalls-when-creating-an-app-and-how-to-avoid-them/&quot;&gt;planning on developing a product&lt;/a&gt; or you are trying to bring your first product iteration to market, the MVP strategy is something very valuable to consider. It allows you to focus on what matters, test your concept, create a working prototype to help get funding, move to market quicker and ultimately, prove that your product is capable of working successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are two important factors you should keep in mind when adopting this strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, an MVP is a means and not an end. It’s a way of getting started and to increment your product, but you should always bear in mind the end goal — that big vision. The MVP is the base, your grand idea is the goal, between them, a timeline with adding, removing, or simply experimenting with features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, when cutting down to essentials, be mindful of which features you omit. It is important that you don’t reduce your value proposition in any way. The value proposition is the core advantage of your product/startup and you don’t want to lose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time.” ― Eric Ries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Bliss, we work with entrepreneurs who have million dollar product ideas to develop but don’t have a million dollars. We not only know how to identify your MVP elements but also walk you down the long road of product development and incrementation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blissapplications.com/contactform#details&quot;&gt;Contact Us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might sound fine to walk into an office with a half-baked idea, nobody has it all figured out. However, walking into an office with an idea of an idea is the first step in a wrong direction.Poorly worked ideas will end up wasting time to develop and time is money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more effort you put into the planning of your idea, the better you will see your product come to life. Nowadays, with the increase in &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2svdTfS&quot;&gt;outsourcing&lt;/a&gt; and remote work, it is critical to have your idea thought out as best as possible. Don’t worry, we’ll show you how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though designers and developers might look like they live on separate planets, they share a fundamental characteristic: function. Both are used to working from a function of a product to its final form. And that is exactly how you should present your next big idea. Put yourself in their position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Good ideas are common — what’s uncommon are people who’ll work hard enough to bring them about.” — Ashleigh Brilliant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where do you even begin to clearly define your idea?
Below, are some starting points that can help you shape your idea to start having the conversations that can make your idea a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really get to know the idea.&lt;/strong&gt; If the vision you want to communicate isn’t totally clear to you, it’s going to be extremely hard to explain it to anyone else. Can you “elevator” pitch it? The best way to clearly define it is to do exactly as an engineer would, break it down into pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the story you are trying to convey?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is your target audience/user?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are your business goals and your biggest challenges?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who is your competition? (Do you have some?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any critical dates?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the answer to these questions in your head is a great start and will help you prepare for your meeting. But don’t stop now, how about going a little bit deeper into what you actually want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do some research.&lt;/strong&gt; You are pitching a complex product and the more knowledge you have about it, the better. How about doing some pre-meeting research? It’s impressive how a little bit of research can get some technical stuff out of the way (yes, even without a degree in Computer Science).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which platforms do you want your product to be on? Smartphones? Tablets? Computers? All of them? &lt;em&gt;Identifying these in advance will not only help shape what exactly you want but also help developers in understanding where you want to be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What operating systems are in scope? Do you want your app to be on iOS or Android? Do you want to make an app for Mac or just for use within a browser?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Considering your users, what will they want to do with your product? Storytelling is a popular technique used to help in this process. &lt;em&gt;For example: As a [someone] I want to [do something] so that I can [get something].&lt;/em&gt; Create a new Excel file and start writing these down. You can see how your idea starts taking shape.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What features do you see in the competition that you want to include? What are others doing in technological terms? This is what developers and designers call benchmarking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map your idea.&lt;/strong&gt;Once you have all of the answers to the questions above, there’s still more to do. Ideas and concepts are often confusing. One tool you (and whomever you are speaking to) might find useful are mind maps. Mind maps are used to turn something mental into something visual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*JIO4wRg2GGtrhZFA.&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people that work in software development are extremely visual. Start by typing your main idea and work your way from there, using most of the elements answered above so that your idea comes to life in a form of a map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can use a piece of paper or a whiteboard once you are at the meeting, but for the sake of time (and cost), here are some popular (and free!) tools you can use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mindmapfree.com/&quot;&gt;Mindmapfree.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/docs/about/&quot;&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.draw.io/&quot;&gt;Draw.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coggle.it/&quot;&gt;Coggle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bubbl.us/&quot;&gt;Bubbl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a prototype.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have come this far, why not get a little technical before the big meeting? Designers often use something called wireframes and mockups to base themselves, or to start a project. These are basically screens of your idea/product, linked together by arrows, to convey an idea of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dslNoOm6THf8dARUpFVdsg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be one of the first steps in designing a product that users really love, and since the developers and designers are going to use it anyway, why not start doing them yourself? It doesn’t have to be pretty, it just has to send a message. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help you out, here are some tools that you can use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pen and paper (no excuse here, just start drawing)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.balsamiq.com/&quot;&gt;Balsamiq&lt;/a&gt; (free trial and easy to use)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sketchapp.com/&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; (a little bit more technical, but really easy to learn)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/pt/products/experience-design.html&quot;&gt;Adobe XD&lt;/a&gt; (another option)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take advantage of your benchmark and competitor’s product as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adapt to your audience.&lt;/strong&gt; When you are excited about an idea, you usually present it as something big and complex. On the other hand, developers are used to thinking of concepts and products like LEGO. Brick by brick. And if you are putting yourself in their shoes, that is exactly what you should do: break it apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When meeting developers, they will start taking apart your idea. So why not take advantage of everything you have done thus far and start doing it yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the several blocks that compose your product?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the purpose of each block?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to they interact?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What blocks are critical for your product to take shape?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line.&lt;/strong&gt;The mind maps, mockups, and answers from the discovery questions above will help you to build, block by block. Completing the steps outlined above will not only make your idea easier to communicate but can potentially save you time, time that can be extremely valuable in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers and designers are used to working with business goals and ideas and making them into a reality. However, the pre-meeting planning depends on how far you are willing to go to have your idea outlined. The effort put into clearly defining your scope of work and refining your idea will help make your vision easier to understand and accelerate the process of development.&lt;/p&gt;

They were first developed in Japanese factories in order to quickly identify pieces or machines. Particularly useful in the confusing data driven world of Japanese car manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, a QR code stores information, such as an URL, and can be decoded by a device (usually, a smartphone!). It’s actually pretty easy to generate a QR code for what ever you like! &lt;em&gt;Just visit&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qrstuff.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;web page, insert a URL and get a scannable code!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-power-of-qr-codes&quot;&gt;THE POWER OF QR CODES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While living in China, as soon as I landed and took my first metro I couldn’t help to notice the absolute explosion of QR codes all around me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at some of the most impressive uses of QR’s in the other side of the world:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of course any of this actions are carried in the same application: The almighty WeChat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-friends&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody uses phone numbers in Asia anymore. When you meet someone, and want to keep their contact; you take your phone out, open WeChat and scan your new friend’s QR code. No need to spell out your phone number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, all you friend does is click his profile picture and display the code in his screen. Of course any of this actions are carried in the same application: The almighty WeChat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This feature finally arrived to Facebook Messenger a few weeks ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;payments&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s it, no Apple Pay, no NFC bullshit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you are in a queue in a Chinese 7Eleven (pretty specific), and the person right in front of you is paying for their coffee. Instead of reaching for their wallet, they reach for their smartphone, and with two clicks, they pay for their cup of coffee. That’s it, no Apple Pay, no NFC bullshit. Paying with QR codes is a fully developed technology in China. Anyone can pay and receive money at anytime, just with WeChat and an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*_WHYuwgIThn3Zl2Jo-Fk_A.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*cWdJ8MfW5R8iLAU08pBJbw.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*X8rKGAHXh9-n-MYqdGjHBA.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this can raise some security-related doubts, but from the tech point of view: its pure awesomeness. Think of the possibilities: maybe your friend owes you money, maybe you want to pay some street food you just bought, a taxi driver, a meal. Pay for everything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wi-fi&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QR code based logins are definitely a reality in China. I have been confronted with mostly two ways of using QR codes to login in a Wi-Fi network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; one is the simplest one. You scan a code, and the WeChat browser opens a window where you read the password and you just copy/paste it onto the settings app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;second&lt;/strong&gt; one is definitely a quicker one. Let’s say you enter a coffee-shop; you scan their QR code. That QR code adds the coffee shop to your WeChat subscriptions. You click in the subscription and send them a message with the text “Wi-Fi”. The page/chat sends you back a link to a page where you can directly log in. Click that blue link and you’re surfing! Its easier to show than to explain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These three examples of QR code uses are just the tip of the iceberg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*zsyReizFugn-G46uT3UzRg.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*fo92LC66hDECYRPwfBuoOA.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*z0LrXo73ohCZaLrDjfgKDw.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These three examples of QR code uses are just the tip of the iceberg. While on our side of the world QR codes are not a part of our technology day-to-day. In places like China, scanning is something they do on a regular basis. Adding someone, paying, joining a page/community, subscribing to news, downloading documents, reading regulations, standing in line of a restaurant, seeing in what station you are, listening to a new advertised singer, scanning your movie ticket or watching a movie trailer. QR codes are everywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-dull-side-of-things&quot;&gt;OUR (DULL) SIDE OF THINGS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our side of the tech-world, QR codes are something we know exists, but most of times is just a thing that sits in the bottom corner of an advertisement. In Europe, QR codes are a neglected technology. Think about it, how many times have you used a QR code this week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, most of the success of QR codes in China is due to a big technology company like WeChat having the courage (or should I say: not having the fear) of implementing this technology. But not only WeChat uses QR’s. Big Chinese tech players like Taobao, QQ, Youku and JD are using QR’s as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another hand, it seems like some big tech players on our side of things are starting to implement the technology as well. What I have learned is that, for the technology to thrive, the big companies have to start using it. And “educate” the user so that he can use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snapchat&lt;/strong&gt;: Every Snapchat user has a QR code, and by swiping down on the Snapchat camera you can easily see yours. Adding someone in Snapchat is as simple as pointing the Snapchat camera at a QR code of a friend, and then taping and holding that code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ISgHud8g4Qc74x21agCwqA.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/strong&gt;: Although I think WhatsApp could have a major role in this field, like copying some of WeChat’s features, &lt;em&gt;they seem, for some reason to be much more concerned about privacy&lt;/em&gt;. If launching WhatsApp calling took them 4–5 years, I have really lost hope for them in terms of investing in other things. Their use of QR code has been restricted to their Web based login that you use when you want to use WhatsApp Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;: Facebook briefly launched a QR code system to add new friends but, 2 updates later, that system looks like it has been abandoned. This system was just like WeChat’s “scan and add” system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QR codes in the western world are also used in the manufacturing industry to identify products nowadays. The technology is also very used in advertisement. But somehow it always seems to be used in a “oh and here is a QR code for the 0.5% of you that are going to scan it” way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pretty hot topic nowadays when we look to countries is the use of QR codes for payments. The thing is, European/American users and Asian users are very different. Their concerns about security, or user experience are very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a user just like you and me (probably) values design and sometimes even minimalism in websites, the Asian user tends to like clutter and the mentality of “does it do everything?”. Web-security and data privacy follows the same guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we think about it, services like Apple Pay are systems that a western user has no problem using because it is developed on the hardware side of things, so security is guaranteed by Apple engineers. And of course, fingerprints Vs QR, we all know which seems more secure. But if we think of payments using a QR code and 6-digit pin code, they are not so different from the bank system which uses a card and a 4-digit pin code. Of course companies like WhatsApp and WeChat storing your bank card information can raise some preoccupation but at the end of the day, it also simplifies things, a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bottom-line&quot;&gt;BOTTOM LINE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QR codes have potential. That potential is undeniable. The problem is, it actually has to be faster than typing. If we have an iPhone, just to scan a simple QR code in an advertisement can be a pain. We have to download an app that scans QRs, and then scan it, but of course this app will open the URL in a dedicated browser that most of times is not good. And then the user has to open the webpage in Safari. This is too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts on the topic are that, in order for the west to experience the true potential of QR codes, one of the big Western-Tech companies will have to make a bald bet on QR codes. WhatsApp (a Facebook product) is the first that comes to mind, the Facebook app as well. What this companies seem to ignore is that this software upgrade to their apps is minimal but can go a very long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be very sad to lose the wave of QR code use, because it is a system that can make use both save time and “clicks” but that can also simplify things like payments. Payments could stop being something only available on a smartphone with fingerprint sensor or NFC technology and could be something at the reach of every user that has a smartphone with a camera.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>duarteocarmo</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="technology" /><summary type="html">A QR (Quick Response) code is a tool by which we can transfer data from a place to another.
