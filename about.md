My name is Duarte Carmo and I'm originally from Lisbon, Portugal.

I'm currently a product manager at Jabra where I spend most of my time thinking on how we can make the best headphones in the world.

I currently live in Copenhagen. 

You can probably find me learning about new gadgets, programming in python, or reading science fiction. 

To get in touch, just email me at [me@duarteocarmo.com](mailto:me@duarteocarmo.com).
