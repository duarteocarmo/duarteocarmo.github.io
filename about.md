My name is Duarte Carmo and I'm originally from ☀️Lisbon, Portugal and I currently live in ☔Copenhagen, Denmark. 

I'm a product manager at [Jabra](https://jabra.com) where I help build the best 🎧headphones in the world and also build 💻software tools to help the company.

I have studied in the [Superior Technical Institute of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), in the [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/) and in the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english).
