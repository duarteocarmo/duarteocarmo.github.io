<p>Analyst in Business Development and Strategy at Jabra. Here, my main responsibility is to use technology to help drive the business forward. Also, I’m a recent graduate in Management Engineering and Technology at the Technical University of Denmark.</p>

<p>I have a wide range of knowledge in software development, data science, software tools and mobile technologies. I have 2 years of experience programming and tinkering with computers.</p>

<p>I’m an addict of all things technology, and can’t pass a day without reading the most recent trends, innovations, and dramas of the technology world.</p>

<p>Entrepreneur at the WYGroup where I got to create my own company (crowdsourced deliveries), I started from scratch and ended up managing a team of 6 engineers and designers for almost 8 months.</p>

<p>I have lived in over 4 countries (Portugal, Denmark, China, USA), and I’m fluent in 4 languages (Portuguese, English, French, and Spanish). I’ve visited over 70 countries and love photography and design. </p>
